### Steps:
#1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value `8`.
#2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value `10`.
#3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
#4. Print the value of the sum to the console.

#assigning an integer to the first variable 
apple = (int(8))

#assigning an integer to the second variable 
samsung = (int(10))

#Adding both the first and second variable to the third variable
huawei = (apple + samsung)

#print the variable huawei
print (huawei)
